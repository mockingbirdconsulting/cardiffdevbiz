# Cardiff Dev Slack group business directory
A site containing business run by Cardiff Dev Slack group members.

## Add your org via github.com
Without needing to know about Hugo or anything, you should do the following to add your own org via the github website:

1. Fork the repo
2. Upload your company logo (square or portrait ideal) to the static/img/portfolio directory
3. Create a new file in the `content/portfolio/` dir named after your org
4. Paste the contents from an existing entry and amend to suit. If you have a square logo set `showonlyimage` to false
5. Submit a PR

Once you've submitted a PR netlify will give you a link to a preview of the site with your information. You can continue editing your listing and the preview will update so that you can ensure you're happy with it.

We will periodically review PRs and add entries.
